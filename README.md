# CIT 382 Capstone – React Frontend

This project is a React-based frontend for a property management database application originally developed in CIT 381. The goal of this capstone is to rebuild and improve the frontend using React and Vite, with a focus on clearer state management, component structure, and incremental development.

At this stage, the project is intentionally early and not feature-complete. The emphasis is on setting up a solid foundation and rebuilding core functionality one piece at a time rather than attempting a full rewrite immediately.

## Current Progress

- React + Vite project initialized
- Basic project structure in place
- Residents page implemented with:
  - Data fetching from an existing Express API
  - Search functionality
  - Sorting
  - State-driven UI updates
  - Delete action with optimistic updates

## Intended Functionality

The application is intended for internal property management use, including:

- Viewing and searching residents
- Managing related data (units, leases, payments, etc.)
- Providing a clean, maintainable React-based interface backed by an existing database

Additional features will be added incrementally over the course of the term.

## Backend

This frontend connects to an existing backend built in CIT 381 using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The backend is maintained separately and is not included in this repository.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress and will continue to evolve throughout the term. The current implementation prioritizes direction and structure over polish.
